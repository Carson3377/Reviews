JavaScript Project--
# Reviews

In this JavaScript project, we're going to create a review carousel with descriptions and a button that generates random reviews when clicked. --This is a good feature to have on an ecommerce site to display customer reviews or a personal portfolio to display client reviews.--

The JavaScript key methods may be applied:

- objects
--> List of array in objects. List of candidates with job and information about each individual.


- DOMContentLoaded
--> Pairs with 'window' method, it fires when the HTML document has been completely parsed without having the images,    stylehsheet, etc to finish loading. In other words, immediate loading when function executed.


- addEventListener()
--> Includes an event 'click' or 'DOMContentLoaded' pairs with 'window' method.


- array.length
--> Length of the array list 0-3 means 4.


- textContent
--> Changes a specified text content like names, jobs, images, and information. 


- If statement (Only If)
--> Includes true statement only. 


That's a Wrap!
